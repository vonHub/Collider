COLLIDER is a simple 2d two-player game.

Each person controls a single sphere with the arrow keys. They move around
inside an arena and attempt to knock the other player into bumpers in the arena.
Games last x seconds, with the winner being whoever hit the bumpers the
fewest times.

Players will only be able to change direction slowly, but will be able to accelerate
to a very high speed. Hitting the arena wall or bumper will cause the player to
ricochet; hitting another player will do the same, with an additional boost in
speed way from each other, so that players colliding at even very low speeds will
receive a noticeable kick away from each other.

Under their own control, players will not be able to exceed a certain speed; this
can be done by achieving maximum or near-maximum speed, but the player will then
slowly decelerate until reaching the normal maximum speed.

Now pray to your favorite Elder God that I can finish this in time.
